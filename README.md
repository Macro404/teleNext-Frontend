##teleNext front-end

teleNext is a Next.js web app designed to give front-end UI to our REST api.

The app offers direct sales of mobile phones as well as dataplan subscriptions.

We utilized Next-Auth with Google OAuth2 Provider for security and ease of use.

For payments we implemented Stripe elements so users can complete the payment without leaving our site.

The public / generic pages are rendered server side.

The styling is responsive and with a 'mobile first' approach, giving a sleek design irregardless of device / display.
